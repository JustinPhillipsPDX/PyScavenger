# PyScavenger
PyScavenger is an open-source Python web crawler that automates the process of collecting data from websites.


## Getting Started with PyScavenger
PyScavenger v1.0 will be distrubuted as a standalone package, with the two dependencies included (without needing to worry
about installing additional libraries). In the meantime, users can get up and running by following the 
instructions below for dependencies:
### Package Requirements
You'll need to install two Python packages before running the code:

1. Requests: A package that allows you to send HTTP requests in Python.
   
   ```
   python -m pip install "requests"
   ```
3. BeautifulSoup: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
   
   ```
   python -m pip install "beautifulsoup4"
   ```
Once you've installed both packages, you should be able to run the Python script without issues.
